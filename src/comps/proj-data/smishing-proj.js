            This mini-project is a Web-Poster designed to showcase an early version of an Android app called &apos;Smishing Buster&apos;.
            The app was developed in an academic setting as part of a CS degree, with the purpose of helping users protect themselves from SMS phishing—also known as &apos;Smishing&apos;.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Web-Poster presents the concept, mechanics, and a video demo of the app in a clean and minimalist format.
